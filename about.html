            Hi! I'm Robby, a web developer with a passion for quality. I enjoy
            understanding and developing systems with an emphasis on simplicity.
            In my free time I enjoy sports (GO BLAZERS!), listening to podcasts,
            and playing all kinds of games. You can usually find me riding
            around Portland Oregon with a cribbage board riding shotgun.

          <h3 class="text-tertiary">Customer Focused</h3>
          <p>
            My experience includes over seven years of testing experience with a
            wide range of platforms including Xbox, iOS, Android, Front-End, and
            Back-End web applications. I have developed a keen sense for
            customer expectations, priorities, and values. I’ve also cultivated
            an eye for detail, a devotion to quality, and a practical
            understanding of risk assessment.

          <h3 class="text-tertiary">Team Player</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve worked with remote teams around the world, enjoyed the startup
            into acquisition journey, and have contributed to teams in multiple
            phases of the software development lifecycle. Through all this a few
            things remain clear to me, communication is key, everyone is on the
            same team, and don’t underestimate the power of team morale.

        <div class="skill skill-3">
          <h3 class="text-tertiary">Technical Aptitude and Desire to Learn</h3>
          <p>
            My curiosity for design and technology has led me on a quest from 3D
            animator, video game tester, software quality engineer, and most
            recently full stack web developer. My latest accomplishment is
            alumni of the amazing

            curriculum! It was a blast and I learned a ton of skills which I
            can’t wait to leverage to bring a ton of value into the world.
