          <p>
            It's me Robby! I'm a web developer with a passion for quality. I
            enjoy understanding and developing systems with an emphasis on
            simplicity. In my free time I enjoy sports (GO BLAZERS!), listening
            to podcasts, and playing all kinds of games...you can usually find
            me riding around Portland Oregon with a cribbage board and deck of
            cards riding shotgun.

          <h3 class="text-tertiary">Customer Focused</h3>
          <p>
            With over seven years of testing experience on platforms ranging
            from Xbox, iOS, Android, web applications, and micro service server
            applications I have developed a keen sense for customer
            expectations, priorities, and values. I’ve also cultivated an eye
            for detail, a devotion to quality, and a practical understanding of
            risk assessment.

          <h3 class="text-tertiary">Team Player</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve worked with remote teams around the world, enjoyed the startup
            into acquisition journey, and have contributed to teams in multiple
            phases of the software development lifecycle. Through all this a few
            things remain clear to me, communication is key, everyone is on the
            same team, and don’t underestimate the power of morale.

          <h3 class="text-tertiary">Technical Aptitude and Desire to Learn</h3>
          <p>
            My curiosity for design and technology has led me on a voyage from
            3D animator, video game tester, software quality engineer, and most
            recently full stack web developer. My latest accomplishment is
            alumni of the amazing

            curriculum! It was a blast and I learned a ton of skills which I
            can’t wait to leverage to bring a ton of value into the world.
